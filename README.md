## How to run

This project writes the SRD data into a normalized SQLite database.

By default the database is written to `data/5e-database.sqlite`.

The schema uses these core tables:

- `sources`
- `lookups`
- `entities`
- `features`
- `spells`
- `items`
- `actors`
- `links`

You can build or rebuild it locally by running:

```bash
npm run db:refresh
```

Or seed it directly with the dedicated seed script:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

To use a custom path:

```bash
SQLITE_DB_PATH=./tmp/5e-database.sqlite npm run db:refresh
```

`db:refresh` and `db:seed` both rebuild the database from the JSON source files.

`db:update` is currently not implemented for the normalized schema:

```bash
npm run db:update
```
